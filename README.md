# About 

This repo contains personal configuration and rc files for my WSL2
development environment. To set up the development environment using
this repository, simply navigate to this repo's root directory and run the below command. 

```bash
sudo bash wsl_dev_setup.sh
```

This is a living document based on my personal development needs.
